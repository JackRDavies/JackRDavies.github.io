    I currently study at Sandwell Campus, a college that is based in West Bromwhich of the West Midlands, UK. The course I am studying is Website Development Level 2, which covers Multimedia Product Development, IT Networking, Employability and the Online World.<br><br>
    
    
    <h3 class="inst white">Multimedia</h3>
    
    My multimedia course covers the process of designing a product for a specific audience, designing the product to suit a specific purpose aswell as provides information on how a product can be improved and testing. Furhtermore it provides information on what assets can be used in a digital product. <br><br>
    
    The multimedia unit of my college studies is the most vital part of the course as it aims to improve your production skills in the real world, covering the fundamentals of product design and usability.<br><br>

      In my multimedia lessons, we had to go through the process of designing and producing products, one of them being a presentation for schools that was targeted at staying healthy. We had to develop one interactive and one non-interactive product, so for the interactive one I decided to make a simple pacman-like game which required the player to eat the healthy food:<br><br>

      Before I was able to create the product, I had to go through the process of planning what assets to use, what the layout should be like etc.<br><br>

      During the process of developing a product, we (me and the class) are expected to go through a few stages before making a product, those being the following:<br>
      
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>Ideas</li>
        <li>Research</li>
        <li>Plan/Design</li>
      </ul>
      
      Once these stages are complete and we are happy with our designs, we progress onto making the product which will be evaluated later on.<br>

    <h3 class="inst white">Networking</h3>
    
    One of the 2nd most important topics of this course is being able to understand the computer networking topologies, which is a big deal when it comes to todays Business IT sector as it allows computers to interact with one another. Throughout the course we were informed of networking subjets, routers, switches, firewalls, routers and other fundamentals such as types of cables and connectors, e.g. CAT5, RJ45 etc.<br><br>
    
    One of the tasks that we were assigned during this unit was to make a functional Windows-Based network that allowed computers to access a shared resource with different user accounts and group policies. Of course, for me this was an easy subject as I have networking experience from my <a href="#embedded" onclick="view('embedded', 'buildingK9')">Robotics project</a> and <a href="#embedded" onclick="view('embedded', 'raspberry-pi'); setTimeout(function(){ $('#Pi-serverReadMore').trigger('click'); }, 600);">Webserver project</a>.<br><br>

      IT networking and security is fundamental in this area of computing and is a must for any Administrator or website producer as it is the magic that allows a computer to interconnect with one another, allowing people to access websites and information.<br><br>
      
      The task I was assigned was fairly straight forward as Microsoft provide both GUI and CLI methods of creating and managing a computer network. In the scenario I was provided, I had to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_network">star topology network</a> which required the following devices:<br>
      
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>Ethernet cable with RJ45 connector</li>
        <li>Router</li>
        <li>3 computers/laptops with RJ45 Ethernet ports.</li>
      </ul>
      
      That was pretty much all the hardware requireed to produce this simple network, everything else was created through software. Here is some of the commands that I used for configuring the network and the devices connected to it:<br><br>

      After configuring the network and things such as homegroup, I was able to share resources with the other computers on the network and even mount them as virtual drives:<br><br>
