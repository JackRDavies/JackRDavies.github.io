  <div class="whitebackground black content">
    Raised in Sandwell of the United Kingdom, my passion for technology spreads from hardware to software. In my free time, I'm known to dabble in coding websites, bike riding, watching anime and taking pictures of new places. Late in the year 2014, I bought my first proper piece of camera equipment and gained a small interest in photography.<br><br>
    
    I'm 17 years old (as of writing this) and I have dreams of moving to America, where I can be involed in more technology-related events such as CES and Defcon - two big events that only take place within the United States. I'm quite the softie when it comes to animals, too.<br><br>
    
    My main interests are IT networking and website development, which is something that I'd like to specialise in when I get older - Of course, this is what influenced my choice of course when I applied for my <a href="#embedded" onclick="view('embedded', 'college')">current college studies</a>. I like being the one in control and I think it's fun to build computer networks as you know how it all goes together, much like lego.

    <h3 class="inst white">Programming</h3>
    
    I initially started my road to programming at the age of 12, with simple Windows Batch scripts - small text-based programs that are executed from within the Windows Command Line (CMD). Scripts were basic at first but later adapted to be far more complex and sophisticated than most, from simple text output to being able to recieve user input and even configuring things on a system-wide level. My largest script has become other 4000 lines in length, which took a few months to develop back when I was in secondary school.<br><br>

    Of course, I later developed my skills to be much more than just simple little scripts. I learned other programming languages such as PHP, HTML, Python, C and many others, which were mainly inspired by the <a href="https://raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, which I have covered in my <a href="#embedded" onclick="view('embedded', 'raspberry-pi')">Raspberry Pi Projects</a> section.<br><Br>
